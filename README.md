# Movies--Data-Analysis-Project-
Movies on Netflix, Prime, Hulu and Disney+ Analysis <br>

In this project, we wanted to analyze information about some of the best movies on our most familiar platforms, <br>
like Netflix, Prime video and more. <br> (the data set used is on the CSV file). <br>

Our main questions we tried to study from this analysis were: <br>

Is there a linear correlation between IMDb ratings and Rotten Tomatoes ratings? <br>

Is there a certain distribution to IMDb ratings?
